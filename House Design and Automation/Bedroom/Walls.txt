Bedroom walls idea.
geometric shapes stuck to wall in asthetically pleasing and funcional places.
Horizontal areas good for shelving etc.
shapes and wall should have a strong contrast to reflect a modern/contemporary look and to make the person see them (not bump head etc.)
planter box along the top of the wall with small halogen? downlights to provide small source of light for photosynthesis. Low light plants only. preferably ferns of vine style plants to droop down the wall. would require water system. Alternative just use fake plants?


Need to investigate a  air freshener to work continuously freshening the air within the bedroom.
Door & window open/closed will affect? solar power with small battery should offset electricity costs mostly if not completely.
