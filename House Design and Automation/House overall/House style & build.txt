House ideas

- shipping container house built into hill.
	- less heating & cooling costs
	- no rain water catchment?
	- easy to work on roof
	- potential for expansion only outside hill once constructed?
	- reasonably cheap to constuct? welding mostly/ would require 3 or 4 minimum for reasonable house.
	- could use 1 for garage/car storage?
