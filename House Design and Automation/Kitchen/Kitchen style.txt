Keep to simple kitchen style.
function with style. modern look. Mostly minimalistic with a modern flare.
-Source bowls where its likely that many will be able to be sourced again later after some broken etc.
-keep similar colour scheme across kitchen. Not just walls& countertops etc, but with cookware and bowls and plates etc as well.
